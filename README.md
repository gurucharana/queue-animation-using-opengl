# queue-animation-using-opengl
this project includes the  queue operation using opengl 
This Mini-Project titled “An Animation Of Working Of Queue Operations” is based on Basic
 Queue Operations.
 Queue is a data structure which is a collection of ordered homogeneous data elements in which 
 insertion and deletion operation take place at both the ends. Insertion is done at the FRONT end
 and deletion is done at the REAR end.
 Insertion operation is termed ENQUEUE and deletion operation is termed DEQUEUE. 
 
 Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
 Real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first,
 exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.
